## Description

This project is a portfolio of my work, with a blurb about myself, as well as my contact information.

This portfolio is for prospective employers to see what I am capable of to determine whether or not I am worthy of being hired.

## Installation

No steps are required to install this application

## Usage

This is a fairly simple website. There are three buttons at the top which navigate to the corresponding articles within the page.

There are three active links to the cards in the "Work" section that navigate to projects I've worked on. The last two cards are inactive but still present as links.

My email address and github links are active in the contact section, but I do not yet have personal website... well, I suppose this website ultimately is to become my personal website.

## Credits

I have no collaborators, but I did use a couple pictures from Unsplash.com.

I also utelized a background creation tool from https://www.magicpattern.design/tools/css-backgrounds.
